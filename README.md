# magento-limitrole-module

This module, designed for Magento 2, limits users who do not have **Full Access** rights from assigning a user to a role that does have Full access rights. 

This might be useful in an agency scenario where the customer wants to be able to assign users to roles but should not be able to assign roles that have full access when they do not either.

# Update #

1.0.1 : Limits user's who do not have **Full Access** won't be able to see the admin role.
